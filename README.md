# Candy Duds üç¨

## Overview

A web-based replication of the renowned Candy Rack App, meticulously crafted to showcase pop-ups and special offers. This project was built using a modern tech stack, including React for dynamic UI components, Tailwind for utility-first styling, and Styled Components for component-specific styles. To ensure a seamless user experience, I integrated Cypress for end-to-end testing, validating the application's functionality and responsiveness.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Pop-ups**: Showcases special offers and interactive pop-ups to engage users.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Leveraging React for component-based architecture, TailwindCSS for utility-first design, and Styled Components for encapsulated styles.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Implemented Cypress testing to ensure robust functionality and seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
